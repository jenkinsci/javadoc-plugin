This plugin adds Javadoc support to Jenkins.
This functionality used to be a part of the core, but as of Jenkins 1.431, it was split off into a separate plugin.

The plugin enables the selection of "Publish Javadoc" as Post-build action, specifying the directory where the Javadoc is to be gathered and if retention is expected for each successful build.

## Changelog
